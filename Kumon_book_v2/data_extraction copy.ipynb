The common elements across the prompts include:\\n- **Category:** Arithmetic\\n- **Operation:** Subtraction\\n- **Numbers:** Two-digit numbers\\n- **Structure/Format:** Vertical subtraction or inline subtraction, with the minuend (top number) always larger than or equal to the subtrahend (bottom number).\\n- **Difficulty:** Ranges from basic subtraction (no borrowing) to subtraction that may involve borrowing.\\n- **Constraints:** Fixed or variable minuend, subtrahend ranges, and systematic question sequencing (e.g., incrementally increasing subtrahends or alternating fixed and variable numbers).\\n\\n### Patterns Observed:\\n1. **Fixed vs. Variable Numbers:** \\n   - Some problems use a fixed minuend across a block of questions, while others allow both minuend and subtrahend to vary within defined ranges.\\n2. **Incremental or Random Variations:** \\n   - Subtrahends often change incrementally (e.g., in small steps) or randomly within a range.\\n3. **Layouts:** \\n   - Vertical alignment is the dominant format, with some prompts also providing inline examples (e.g., `62 - 31`).\\n4. **Borrowing Considerations:** \\n   - Questions may or may not require borrowing, often specified as a difficulty level.\\n5. **Sequential Question Blocks:** \\n   - Many prompts group questions where one number (often the minuend) remains constant for a set, followed by a new constant number for the next set.\\n6. **Non-Negative Results:** \\n   - All results are non-negative, ensuring the minuend is always greater than or equal to the subtrahend.\\n\\n### Master Prompt:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"category\": \"Arithmetic\",\\n  \"pattern\": {\\n    \"operation\": \"Subtraction\",\\n    \"structure\": {\\n      \"description\": \"Two two-digit numbers are subtracted, where the minuend (top number) is always greater than or equal to the subtrahend (bottom number).\",\\n      \"format\": \"Vertical or inline subtraction layout\",\\n      \"constraints\": {\\n        \"minuend\": {\\n          \"type\": \"fixed or variable\",\\n          \"range\": \"Two-digit numbers (e.g., 30-99)\"\\n        },\\n        \"subtrahend\": {\\n          \"type\": \"variable\",\\n          \"range\": \"Two-digit numbers less than or equal to the minuend\"\\n        }\\n      },\\n      \"difficulty\": \"Basic subtraction, with or without borrowing\",\\n      \"sequence\": \"Questions are grouped into blocks with either a fixed minuend or varying numbers, and subtrahends may change incrementally, systematically, or randomly.\"\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \"example_questions\": [\\n    {\\n      \"minuend\": 72,\\n      \"subtrahend\": 31,\\n      \"question\": \"72 -

Across the examples, certain patterns emerge:\\n\\n1. **Progression in Difficulty**: Subtrahends increase incrementally, either by tens or hundreds, within a set of questions.\\n2. **Consistency in Minuend**: A fixed minuend is often used within a series of questions, while the subtrahend changes.\\n3. **Scenario-Based Subtraction**: Some prompts include real-world contexts, where subtraction is framed as \"how many remain\" after a certain action.\\n4. **Sequence Completion**: Subtraction is also used in decremental number sequences where missing values must be filled in.\\n5. **Presentation Formats**: Both vertical and horizontal layouts are explored, with emphasis on proper alignment (place value) and clear subtraction operators.\\n\\nThe questions are primarily **leveling up** in nature, as they involve incremental increases in difficulty, such as larger subtrahends, more borrowing scenarios, or more complex sequences.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Master Prompt:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"category\": \"Arithmetic\",\\n  \"pattern\": {\\n    \"operation\": \"Subtraction\",\\n    \"structure\": \"A 3-digit number (minuend) subtracted by a 2-digit or 3-digit number (subtrahend).\",\\n    \"difficulty\": {\\n      \"levels\": [\\n        {\\n          \"type\": \"Basic\",\\n          \"description\": \"Subtraction without borrowing.\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n          \"type\": \"Moderate\",\\n          \"description\": \"Subtraction requiring borrowing in some cases.\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n          \"type\": \"Advanced\",\\n          \"description\": \"Subtraction with progressively larger subtrahends and multiple borrowing steps.\"\\n        }\\n      ]\\n    },\\n    \"formats\": [\\n      \"Vertical subtraction layout with placeholders for answers.\",\\n      \"Horizontal subtraction format with clear operators.\",\\n      \"Scenario-based questions involving real-world contexts.\",\\n      \"Sequential decrement problems with missing values to complete.\"\\n    ],\\n    \"progression\": \"Within a set, the subtrahend increases incrementally by tens, hundreds, or specific patterns to level up difficulty.\"\\n  },\\n  \"question_templates\": [\\n    {\\n      \"type\": \"Basic Vertical Subtraction\",\\n      \"template\": \"Align the following subtraction problem vertically and solve: [MINUEND] - [SUBTRAHEND] = ?\",\\n      \"examples\": [\\n        {\"minuend\": 325, \"subtrahend\": 42},\\n        {\"minuend\": 478, \"subtrahend\": 156}\\n      ]\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"type\": \"Horizontal Subtraction\",\\n      \"template\": \"Solve the following subtraction problem: [MINUEND] - [SUBTRAHEND] = ?\",\\n      \"examples\": [\\n        {\"minuend\": 634, \"subtrahend\": 318},\\n        {\"minuend\": 789, \"subtrahend\": 456}\\n      ]\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"type\": \"Scenario-Based Subtraction\",\\n      \"template\": \"There were [MINUEND] [OBJECTS] in [CONTEXT].

Fixed minuends with varying subtrahends.\\n   - Incremental or sequential variations in subtrahend values.\\n   - Specific constraints on the tens or ones digit of the minuend or subtrahend.\\n   - Problems where the subtraction operation adheres to a consistent theme (e.g., no borrowing, borrowing required, fixed number relationships).\\n\\n5. **Presentation Style**:\\n   - Problems are shown with clear formatting, often using vertical subtraction with a horizontal line for the result.\\n   - Some problems specify constraints in their descriptions (e.g., \"no borrowing\" or \"borrowing required\").\\n\\n### Pattern of Question Progression:\\n- **Leveling Up**:\\n  - Problems become more complex as constraints relax (e.g., introducing borrowing, increasing subtrahend size, or narrowing the range between minuend and subtrahend).\\n  - Fixed minuend problems evolve into incrementally increasing subtrahends.\\n  - Problems transition from single-digit subtrahends to two-digit subtrahends.\\n- **Leveling Down**:\\n  - Simpler problems avoid borrowing or limit the range of the subtrahend.\\n  - Problems with fixed minuends and predictable subtrahends maintain a lower complexity level.\\n\\n### Master Prompt:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"category\": \"Arithmetic\",\\n  \"pattern\": {\\n    \"operation\": \"Subtraction\",\\n    \"structure\": \"Two-digit subtraction problems where the layout, constraints, and difficulty vary based on defined patterns.\",\\n    \"difficulty\": {\\n      \"levels\": [\"Simple subtraction without borrowing\", \"Subtraction with borrowing\"],\\n      \"progression\": \"Subtrahends increase incrementally or range-adjusted to increase complexity.\"\\n    },\\n    \"number_constraints\": {\\n      \"minuend\": {\\n        \"range\": \"50–99\",\\n        \"variations\": [\"Fixed for a series\", \"Constrained to a specific range\", \"Varied across questions\"]\\n      },\\n      \"subtrahend\": {\\n        \"range\": \"1–99\",\\n        \"variations\": [\"Single-digit\", \"Two-digit\", \"Incremental sequence\"]\\n      }\\n    },\\n    \"alignment\": \"Vertically aligned subtraction with digits aligned by place value.\",\\n    \"result\": \"Always a positive number.\"\\n  },\\n  \"example_questions\": [\\n    {\\n      \"type\": \"Fixed minuend with varying subtrahends\",\\n      \"questions\": [\\n        \"72 -

This ensures the prompt can replicate the observed question patterns.\\n3. **Constraints and Difficulty**: Parameters for difficulty (single-digit divisors, two-digit dividends) and result formats (quotients with or without remainders) are explicitly included to maintain consistency.\\n4. **Example Questions**: Example questions are drawn from the provided prompts to illustrate the two variants, ensuring clarity for future question generation.\\n\\n### Observed Patterns:\\n- **Leveling Up or Down**: The questions exhibit a leveling-up pattern, where dividends either increase sequentially or in groups. Divisors are fixed for a series and then change in a new block, maintaining logical progression.\\n- **Question Variants**: Both simple division and division with remainders are present. In the case of remainders, the result format explicitly includes the quotient and remainder (e.g., \"Q R R\").\\n- **Range and Complexity**: Dividends are either sequential integers, multiples of the divisor, or progress non-linearly.
