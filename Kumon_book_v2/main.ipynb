      "Alright, let me try to figure out how to respond to this user's query. They want a Python dictionary that contains arithmetic expressions similar to their original set but with new ones of the same type. The sample questions provided include both positive and negative exponents, as well as exponents on fractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I need to understand the structure they're expecting. The initial response had questions like (1) to (10), each with an algebraic expression. They now want similar expressions but different from the original ones. So I should create new problems that fit the same number and type of operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at their sample questions, they have exponentiation with both positive and negative bases and various exponents. For example, (-2)^2, (-2)^3, etc., as well as fractions like (−½)^2 and (-⅔)^3. There are also some where the negative sign is outside the exponent, such as -(-2)^5.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should generate new expressions that mirror these but use different numbers or variables to avoid duplication. Let's see: perhaps using 3 instead of -2, like (3)^4, (3)^5, etc., and also include fractions such as (−⅓)^2 or something similar. Also, negative bases with positive exponents and negative exponents.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure each expression is properly formatted in LaTeX for MathJax rendering. So I'll use the appropriate syntax for superscripts and negatives. For example, (-2)^5 becomes \\((-2)^5\\) and -(−3)^4 becomes -\\((−3)^4\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I should check that the numbering from (1) to (10) is maintained, just like in their original set. This means each new expression should be a similar structure but with unique problems.\n",

      "Let me list out possible expressions:\n",

      "1. A positive exponent on 3: (3)^4\n",
      "2. Negative exponent on -4: (-4)^-2\n",
      "3. Positive exponent on a fraction: \\((−\\frac{1}{2})^5\\)\n",
      "4. Negative exponent on a negative base: \\((-5)^{-3}\\)\n",
      "5. Negative sign before the base with positive exponent: -(−6)^4\n",
      "6. Fraction with negative exponent: \\(\\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{-2}\\)\n",
      "7. Positive exponent on 7: (7)^6\n",
      "8. Negative exponent on fraction: \\((-\\frac{1}{4})^{-5}\\)\n",
